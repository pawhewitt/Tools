When called in the location of the configuration file the code plots and exports both the geometric differences of the two designs as well as the change in objective function in the range of designs between the two.  

# plot_design.py

ARGUEMENTS -d design 

Called in the location of the configuration file. Creates a folder and exports a number of plots to it. Plots include Adjoint data, design's geometry, the Geometric Sensitivities, the gradients and the pressure distribution.
